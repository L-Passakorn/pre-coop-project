feat: initialize full-stack Simple Diaries application

Initialize complete project structure for Simple Diaries application with
Spring Boot backend and Next.js frontend.

Backend (Spring Boot 3.4.0 + Java 21):
- Initialize Maven project with Spring Boot 3.4.0
- Configure dependencies: Spring Web, Security, Data JPA, PostgreSQL
- Add JWT authentication library (jjwt 0.12.5)
- Set up JaCoCo for code coverage (60% minimum)
- Create package structure: controller, service, repository, entity, dto, security, exception
- Add Maven wrapper for consistent builds
- Configure application.properties with environment variable support
- Create comprehensive README with setup instructions

Frontend (Next.js 15 + React 19):
- Reorganize existing Next.js project into frontend/ directory
- Move all Next.js configuration and source files
- Update package structure and dependencies
- Configure Tailwind CSS 4.x and TypeScript 5.x
- Create frontend-specific README

Project Infrastructure:
- Add comprehensive .gitignore for both frontend and backend
- Create .env.example files for both projects
- Add docker-compose.yml for PostgreSQL and optional full-stack deployment
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Update root README with project overview and structure
- Add TEST_RESULTS.md documenting successful initialization tests

Specifications:
- Add complete requirements document with EARS format
- Add detailed design document with architecture and components
- Add implementation tasks with test-driven approach

Testing:
- Backend: Successfully compiles with Java 25 (compatible with Java 21)
- Frontend: Successfully builds with Next.js 15.5.5 + Turbopack
- All dependencies resolved and verified

This commit establishes the foundation for implementing the Simple Diaries
application following the spec-driven development methodology.
